# flux

Flux us a GitOps engine for Kubernetes.

We are using Flux v2, aks Flux Toolkit.

This directory holds the system components of flux, and it's payload is
generated by the `flux install` command.

To update the payload (i.e. to update flux to a newer version) run
the `./flux-install-gen.sh` script and commit the generated changes to the repo.
